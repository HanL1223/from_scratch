## Hand Coded Transformer with Multihead Self-Attention

This repository contains a hand-coded implementation of a complex model: the Transformer with Multihead Self-Attention. The Transformer model, originally introduced in the field of natural language processing, has demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as machine translation and text generation.

## Overview

The Transformer model revolutionized sequence modeling by employing the self-attention mechanism. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, making it highly effective for processing sequential data. The core idea of the Transformer lies in its ability to process input sequences in parallel, resulting in faster computation and better capture of global information.

The key component of the Transformer model is the multihead self-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, utilizing multiple attention heads. By leveraging multiple attention heads, the model can learn diverse representations and capture various dependencies within the sequence.
